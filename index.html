                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>Hello my name is Peggy and I am currently studying Geographic Information Systems (GIS) at Fleming College.</p>
                    <p>I was born and grew up in Hong Kong. Therefore, I can speak English, Cantonese, and Mandarin fluently. When I was 14 years old, I moved to Edmonton, AB with my family. Moving from a concrete jungle, I was amazed by the natural environment in Canada - Banff and Jasper are always my favorite places!</p>
                    <p>During my undergraduate years, I studied Psychology and Sociology as I enjoy studying human mind and behavior. I love learning new things, and I am currently studying Japanese and Korean in my spare time to learn about different cultures.</p>
                    <p>After graduating from University of Alberta, I started my career as an Insurance Agent at Allstate Insurance. Although I have enjoyed considerable success in the insurance industry, I am enthusiastic about pursuing a career in GIS. I am looking forward to utilizing my knowledge in GIS and Social Science in my future career.</p>

                <h1>PASSION FOR GIS</h1>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>The first time I heard about the term "GIS" was in my Criminal Psychology class, where my professor explained how GIS technology can be applied to crime analysis. At that time, I was amazed by the "magic power" of GIS. After taking a GIS online course on Coursera in my spare time, I recognized that GIS is the right career for me. Therefore I decided to resign from my previous job and go back to school again. The GIS program at Fleming College has prepared me well to become a GIS professional, and I am very excited to apply my knowledge and skills in my future career.</p>
                    <p>My ultimate goal is to utilize my extensive knowledge in GIS and Social Science to make this world a better place.</p>
                </div>

                <h1>WHY ESRI?</h1>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>I am interested in joining Esri Canada because Esri is the pioneer and the leader of the GIS industry. Esri Canada has earned various awards and recognition such as Canada's Best Managed Companies Platinum Member. I was also impressed by the positive experiences shared by the current employees during the Esri Canada Associate Program Presentation.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I believe that the Associate GIS Professional program will provide me an excellent opportunity to learn and grow while contributing to Esri Canada's success. I believe that Esri Canada is a great place to work, and I am excited to start my career at Esri Canada.</p>
